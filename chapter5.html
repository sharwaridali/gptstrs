                <h1 class="display-4">Chapter 5: Shifting Tides</h1>
                <p>The most awaited trip began before sunrise, the five of them piling into the rented car, bleary-eyed but buzzing with excitement. John, the only one with a driver’s license and the oldest of the group, claimed the driver’s seat with the authority of a seasoned captain. Gareth slid into the passenger seat, immediately taking charge of the aux cable, while Aiden, Sheryl, and Hannah crammed into the back.</p>

                <p>John stretched his arms dramatically before gripping the wheel. “Alright, kids. Cornwall awaits. Buckle up, no complaints, and most importantly—no distracting the driver.”</p>

                <p>“Mate, you are the biggest distraction,” Gareth scoffed, scrolling through his phone. “Now, important question—what are we playing first?”</p>

                <p>“I vote for Bob Marley,” John announced. “Road trip rule: you need at least one Bob Marley song before you properly hit the road.”</p>

                <p>“Ugh, predictable,” Gareth groaned. “No offense, but I’m not in the mood for One Love at 4 in the mornin.”</p>

                <p>“Excuse me?” John feigned offense. “You disrespect the legend himself?”</p>

                <p>Aiden, leaning back with his hoodie pulled over his head, grinned. “I mean, he has a point. It’s too early for vibes.”</p>

                <p>“Fine,” John huffed. “What’s your genius pick, then?”</p>

                <p>Gareth smirked. “I’m thinking Cigarettes After Sex. Something chill, moody… good for the soul.”</p>

                <p>Hannah immediately groaned. “Oh no, absolutely not. No Apocalypse is happening.”</p>

                <p>“Then what do you want?” Sheryl finally spoke up, amused by the unfolding chaos.</p>

                <p>Gareth interrupted. “Something timeless. Like Queen that she is.”</p>

                <p>Hannah and John, who was still offended over the Bob Marley rejection, nodded. “Fine. Queen is acceptable.”</p>

                <p>Aiden groaned. “We are not seriously starting this trip with Bohemian Rhapsody.”</p>

                <p>John locked eyes with Gareth. “Oh, we absolutely are.”</p>

                <p>Without warning, Gareth pressed play, and the iconic piano intro filled the car.</p>

                <p>“No. No, no, no,” Aiden protested. “It’s too early for this.”</p>

                <p>“It’s never too early for Queen,” John declared.</p>

                <p>Sheryl just laughed as Aiden dramatically pulled his hoodie further over his face. As the song built up, the entire car—Aiden included—ended up belting the lyrics at full volume, voices cracking, the road stretching endlessly before them.</p>

                <p>They were only an hour into the trip, and it was already absolute chaos.</p>

                <p>Cornwall was going to be interesting.</p>

                <p>By the time they reached Cornwall, the afternoon sun had just begun to rise up, casting a golden glow over the coastline. The long drive, fueled by bad singing and even worse debates over music choices, had left them exhausted yet exhilarated.</p>

                <p>Their BnB, a cozy cottage with whitewashed walls and a sea-facing balcony, was tucked at a perfect spot. As soon as they dumped their bags inside, John stretched dramatically.</p>

                <p>“Right, troops. We have precisely one hour to freshen up before we hit the beach. Anyone who takes longer than that—” he paused, glancing at Aiden. “—will be left behind.”</p>

                <p>Aiden shot a look and ran away to get ready.</p>

                <p>An hour later, the vast expanse of the beach stretched before them, framed by rugged cliffs and the rhythmic crash of rolling waves. The salty breeze was cool against their skin, and the energy of the place was infectious.</p>

                <p>As soon as they stepped onto the sand, Aiden clapped his hands together. “Right, lads. Time to conquer the waves.”</p>

                <p>John, stretching his arms, smirked. “Conquer? Mate, have you ever actually surfed before?”</p>

                <p>“I mean…” Aiden hesitated before flashing a grin. “How hard can it be?”</p>

                <p>Gareth smirked sarcastically.</p>

                <p>The boys made a beeline for the surf shack, renting boards and wetsuits while Sheryl and Hannah lingered near the water, watching as a few seasoned surfers effortlessly glided along the waves.</p>

                <p>At that moment, Aiden jogged back over, surfboard tucked under his arm, wetsuit only half-zipped. “Come on, ladies. Don’t tell me you’re just gonna sit there and watch.”</p>

                <p>John followed, raising an eyebrow at Sheryl and Hannah. “What, scared of a little water?”</p>

                <p>“We’re being sensible,” Sheryl corrected. “Not all of us have a reckless death wish.”</p>

                <p>“Reckless?” Aiden gasped, placing a hand over his heart. “Edris, you wound me.”</p>

                <p>Hannah glanced at the waves again, then back at the boys, who were clearly waiting for them to cave. “Alright, screw it. I’ll try.”</p>

                <p>Sheryl’s eyes widened. “Hannah—”</p>

                <p>“Oh, come on,” Aiden grinned. “See? Hannah’s got the right spirit.”</p>

                <p>Sheryl hesitated, but when Hannah shot her a - you’re really gonna let me do this alone? look, she sighed. “Fine. But if I die, I’m haunting all of you.”</p>

                <p>Sheryl felt ridiculous.</p>

                <p>“This thing is huge,” she muttered, adjusting her grip on the surfboard.</p>

                <p>“You’ll be fine,” Aiden assured her. “Just gotta learn to balance first.”</p>

                <p>“Oh yeah? And you’re an expert now?”</p>

                <p>“Absolutely not,” he admitted. “But confidence is key.”</p>

                <p>The instructor gave them a quick rundown—how to paddle, how to pop up onto the board, how to fall without breaking anything. At first, they practiced lying on their boards in the shallows, trying to get a feel for the motion.</p>

                <p>And then… it was time to actually try.</p>

                <p>Hannah was the first to attempt standing, wobbling unsteadily before toppling sideways into the water. She came up sputtering, shaking her head. “That went so well.”</p>

                <p>Aiden laughed. “Ten on ten for effort.”</p>

                <p>John and Gareth had slightly better luck, at least managing to stay upright for a few seconds before face-planting into the waves. Aiden’s attempt was pure chaos—he got up too fast, wobbled dramatically, flailed his arms, and then disappeared into the water with an impressive splash.</p>

                <p>Sheryl couldn’t help but laugh. “Very graceful.”</p>

                <p>Aiden emerged, pushing his wet hair out of his face. “I meant to do that.”</p>

                <p>“Of course you did.”</p>

                <p>Finally, it was Sheryl’s turn. Heart pounding, she paddled out. “Alright, when you feel the wave take you, pop up,” Aiden instructed.</p>

                <p>Easier said than done. The first time, she barely made it onto her knees before losing balance. The second time, she wobbled and fell sideways with a very undignified yelp.</p>

                <p>By the third attempt, something clicked. As the wave lifted her board, she planted her feet, bent her knees, and—somehow—managed to stay upright.</p>

                <p>Aiden, watching from a distance, cheered. “Edris! Look at you!”</p>

                <p>She barely had a second to celebrate before the wave tilted her off-balance, and she plunged into the water. When she surfaced, coughing out seawater, Aiden was grinning.</p>

                <p>“You were up for a solid three seconds. That’s progress.”</p>

                <p>Sheryl rolled her eyes but couldn’t stop smiling. “Yeah, yeah. I’ll be winning competitions in no time.”</p>

                <p>They spent the next hour attempting to master the waves, failing more than succeeding, but laughing through it all. By the time they finally dragged themselves back onto the sand, exhausted and dripping wet, the sun was beginning to set.</p>

                <p>Sheryl sat up, hugging her knees to her chest as she watched the waves roll in, steady and endless. She exhaled, feeling that rare kind of peace that only came after a day spent in the ocean—drained yet completely alive.</p>

                <p>“The sunset is beautiful,” she murmured, almost to herself.</p>

                <p>Aiden, lying beside her with his arms folded behind his head, turned his head slightly at her words. For a moment, he didn’t reply. His gaze lingered on the horizon, the golden light reflecting in his green eyes. When he finally spoke, his voice was softer than usual, laced with something else—something quieter, heavier.</p>

                <p>“In Japanese,” he said, his tone almost melancholic, “‘The sunset is beautiful’ is another way of saying… ‘I love you, but I’m letting you go.’ Beautiful, right? But it’s also an ending. Something you love, fading away. You don’t want it to, but you can’t hold onto it. You just watch and let it go.”</p>

                <p>Sheryl turned to look at him, surprised. His expression remained unreadable, his face calm, but there was something about the way he said it—like he wasn’t just stating a fact but feeling it.</p>

                <p>She let the words settle between them, watching as the last sliver of sun sank into the horizon.</p>

                <p>It was just a translation. A phrase. And yet, there was something in the way he said it that made her chest feel strangely tight.</p>

                <p>She wanted to ask who he had let go. But she didn’t.</p>

                <p>Instead, she just nodded, letting the sound of the waves fill the silence. Some things were better left unspoken.</p>

                <p>By the time they were showered and refreshed, hunger had taken over. The salty air mixed with the scent of fried food as they walked through the bustling streets, searching for a good spot to eat. They finally settled on a small, family-run restaurant near the harbor, where the menu boasted all the Cornish classics—fish and chips, crab sandwiches, and freshly baked Cornish pasties.</p>

                <p>They piled into a wooden booth, the warm glow of the hanging lights making the place feel cozy.</p>

                <p>“I am so ready for this,” Aiden declared as he rubbed his hands together. “Surfing burns calories. I need to replenish.”</p>

                <p>John scoffed. “Mate, you spent half the time falling off the board.”</p>

                <p>“And yet, my body still worked hard. Respect my struggle.”</p>

                <p>Sheryl shook her head, a small smile playing on her lips as she looked over the menu. She ordered a classic fish and chips, while the others opted for crab sandwiches, prawns, and a round of drinks.</p>

                <p>When the food arrived, the table fell into silence, apart from the occasional sound of approval as they dug in. The battered fish was crispy, the chips perfectly golden, and the tangy tartar sauce tied it all together.</p>

                <p>“Oh my God,” Hannah groaned. “This is the best thing I’ve ever eaten.”</p>

                <p>“Agreed,” Gareth mumbled through a mouthful of crab sandwich.</p>

                <p>Feeling satisfied and re-energized, the conversation naturally drifted toward what to do next.</p>

                <p>“Alright, now that we’ve stuffed ourselves,” Gareth said, stretching back in his chair, “what’s the plan?”</p>

                <p>“Pub crawl?” John suggested casually.</p>

                <p>Aiden grinned. “Now that sounds like a plan.”</p>

                <p>Hannah nodded. “We’re in Cornwall, guys. We must check out the pubs.”</p>

                <p>As the group started discussing which ones to visit first, Sheryl hesitated. She had known a pub outing was inevitable, but now that it was actually happening, she wasn’t sure she wanted to go.</p>

                <p>It wasn’t that she had anything against it—she just wasn’t a pub person. The loud music, the crowds, the dimly lit atmosphere—it had never really been her thing. She preferred places where conversations weren’t drowned out, where she didn’t have to shout to be heard.</p>

                <p>“I think I’ll sit this one out,” she finally said.</p>

                <p>Aiden, already standing up, looked over at her. “You sure?”</p>

                <p>She nodded. “Yeah, I think I’ll just head back to the beach for a bit.”</p>

                <p>John, ever the easygoing one, shrugged. “Fair enough. If you need anything, we are just one call away.”</p>

                <p>Hannah smirked. “If we stay sane...”</p>

                <p>Aiden lingered for a second longer, as if debating whether to stay too. But before he could say anything, Sheryl gave him a small smile. “Go. Have fun. I’ll see you guys later.”</p>

                <p>So, he did.</p>

                <p>Sheryl walked along the shore, the damp sand cool beneath her feet as the tide gently rolled in and out. The distant hum of laughter and chatter from the pubs had faded, leaving only the rhythmic sound of waves crashing against the rocks. The solitude felt different—not lonely, but light.</p>

                <p>She had never really been a pub person. That world—the noise, the crowd, the hazy warmth of dim lights—felt too overwhelming. But here, under the open sky, with the sea stretching endlessly before her, she felt free.</p>

                <p>She exhaled, hugging her arms around herself as a breeze swept through, tousling her hair. Her thoughts drifted, unbidden.</p>

                <p>They kept circling back—to the moments she had tried not to dwell on.</p>

                <p>To Aiden.</p>

                <p>Ever since they became friends, he had always been there to cheer for her, to get her out of her comfort zone and make her feel that she could do it all. Maybe she had it in her, yes, but the way he brought it out was subtle.</p>

                <p>His mere presence made the difference for her.</p>

                <p>The way he called her Edris.</p>

                <p>The way he had cheered for her when she finally stood on the surfboard, grinning like she had just won an Olympic medal.</p>

                <p>The way he had hesitated before going to the pub, like he had been considering staying back with her. The way he had subtly checked if she was sure, even after she had assured him twice.</p>

                <p>The way he had walked her home that night, both of them lingering in that quiet space between conversations, the words feeling heavier than they should have.</p>

                <p>And suddenly, something clicked.</p>

                <p>That night, when she had told him about the Japanese phrase, about “The moon looks beautiful tonight” being a way of saying I love you…</p>

                <p>He had acted like he didn’t know. Like it was news to him.</p>

                <p>And yet today, he had known about the sunset reference in Japanese.</p>

                <p>Why?</p>

                <p>Why had he played dumb that night? Why had he laughed it off, said he’d use it on his girlfriend, when now it was clear that he knew at least some Japanese phrases?</p>

                <p>Maybe he really didn’t know at the time. Maybe the sunset phrase was the only one he had ever come across.</p>

                <p>Sheryl sighed.</p>

                <p>Just like the tides, the moon was pulling her thoughts. Shaking her head as if to brush it off, she closed her eyes.</p>

                <p>It didn’t matter.</p>

                <p>Whatever Aiden Wynne was, whatever pull he had over people, it wasn’t for her to figure out.</p>

                <p>Right now, this—the wind in her hair, the vastness of the ocean, the freedom curling in her chest—was far more important than anything, or anyone, else.</p>

                <p>She kept her eyes closed for a moment, feeling the night air settle around her. Then, without another thought, she turned back toward the cottage, leaving the waves to their endless rhythm.</p>
