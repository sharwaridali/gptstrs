                <h1 class="display-4">Chapter 3: Weathering Storms</h1>
                <p>The weeks following that chance encounter in the library marked a quiet yet significant change in Sheryl’s life. At first, it was the occasional greeting in the hallway or a shared joke about the painfully slow lecturers. Then it was sitting together in the library, Aiden often looking helplessly at his screen while Sheryl nudged him through their coursework.</p>

                <p>“You’re an absolute genius, you know that?” Aiden said one evening, staring in disbelief as Sheryl fixed a problem in his Python code with a few deft keystrokes.</p>

                <p>Sheryl laughed, shaking her head. “I’m not a genius, Aiden. You just panic too much. You'd be fine if you slowed down and read the error messages.”</p>

                <p>“Slowing down is not my thing,”he replied with a grin. “But seriously, I’d have failed without you. I owe you one, Edris.”</p>

                <p>“You owe me more than one, Wynne” she teased. “I’m keeping count.”</p>

                <p>What started as Aiden leaning on Sheryl for academic help soon became something much more mutual. Sheryl discovered that beneath his outward confidence lay a genuine warmth and vulnerability that made her feel at ease in ways she hadn’t expected. Aiden, in turn, found a rare sense of calm in Sheryl’s company—a respite from the noise of the world around him.</p>

                <p>As Easter break approached, the campus began to empty out. Students packed their bags and left for home, leaving the university quieter than usual. Aiden, too, had planned to head back to Ireland for the break. He spoke excitedly about seeing his family, the ferry ride from Holyhead back to Dublin, home-cooked meals, catching up with childhood friends, and maybe a chance to fix things with Ciara.</p>

                <p>But the universe plans differently, Sheryl received a frantic text from him.</p>

                <p><b>Aiden:</b> Ferry’s cancelled. Bloody storm’s hit. Stuck here now. Any plans? Or fancy being a tour guide? 😅</p>

                <p>Sheryl couldn’t help but smile at his words. She had planned to head back home to Cardiff, but showing Aiden some of her favourite spots was unexpectedly appealing. She cancelled the train back home and booked a cab to her favourite spot in Wales.</p>

                <p><b>Sheryl:</b> Tour guide? That depends. Are you okay with getting rained on?</p>

                <p><b>Aiden:</b> Irish, remember? Rain doesn’t scare me. Let’s go.</p>

                <p>Sheryl met Aiden near the university gates, where he was waiting with a rucksack slung over his shoulder, looking uncharacteristically casual in a hoodie and jeans.</p>

                <p>“So, where are we off to, then?” he asked, his Irish lilt carrying a playful note.</p>

                <p>Sheryl smiled, a little nervous but excited. “You’ll see. We’re heading to Brecon Beacons—specifically the Neath waterfall walk.”</p>

                <p>“Waterfalls?” Aiden raised an eyebrow. “Sounds grand. Lead the way, Edris.”</p>

                <p>They hoped on the cab to the Brecon Beacons. Sheryl was quiet as this was the first time for her to go on a trip with a friend. She had always roamed around either alone or with her family.</p>

                <p>When they arrived, the landscape unfolded before them in lush, rolling hills and dense woodland. The air was crisp, carrying the faint scent of damp earth and wildflowers. Sheryl led the way along the well-worn path, the sound of rushing water growing louder with each step.</p>

                <p>“I can’t believe I’ve been here for months and didn’t know this place existed,” Aiden said, his voice filled with awe as they reached the first waterfall. The cascade was stunning, a sheet of white water tumbling down moss-covered rocks into a clear pool below. “It’s like something out of a film.”</p>

                <p>Sheryl smiled, feeling a quiet pride in introducing him to something she loved. “I come here when I need to clear my head. It’s peaceful.”</p>

                <p>They continued along the trail, crossing wooden bridges and navigating slippery rocks. At one point, Aiden slipped on a patch of mud, narrowly avoiding a fall into the stream.</p>

                <p>“Careful!” Sheryl called, stifling a laugh.</p>

                <p>“Careful?” Aiden shot back, grinning as he wiped mud off his jeans. “I’m practically a professional hiker now. That was just a minor setback.”</p>

                <p>By the time they reached Sgwd yr Eira, the most famous waterfall on the route, the sun had broken through the clouds, casting a golden glow over the scene. The waterfall was breathtaking, its powerful roar filling the air as the mist danced in the sunlight.</p>

                <p>“You can walk behind this one,” Sheryl said, gesturing to a narrow path that disappeared behind the curtain of water.</p>

                <p>“No way,” Aiden said, his eyes lighting up. “Let’s do it.”</p>

                <p>They carefully made their way along the slippery path, the sound of the waterfall thundering around them. As they stepped behind the cascade, the world seemed to transform. The water was a shimmering veil, and the air was cool and damp. Sheryl glanced at Aiden, who stood mesmerised, droplets of water clinging to his hair.</p>

                <p>“This is unreal,” he said, turning to her with a wide smile. “I can’t thank you enough for bringing me here.”</p>

                <p>Sheryl felt her heart flutter at the sincerity in his voice. “I’m glad you’re enjoying it.”</p>

                <p>For a moment, they stood there in silence, the sound of the waterfall wrapping around them. Sheryl felt an unfamiliar sense of closeness to Aiden as if the space between them had grown smaller without her even realising it.</p>

                <p>The drive back to campus was filled with laughter and stories. Aiden shared tales of his childhood in Ireland, of summers spent climbing hills and fishing with his brothers. Sheryl found herself opening up, too, sharing memories she usually kept to herself. By the time they arrived back at Swansea, the bond between them felt stronger than ever.</p>

                <p>As Aiden stepped out of the car, he turned back to Sheryl, his expression thoughtful. “You know, this turned out to be one of the best days I’ve had in a long time. Thanks, Sheryl.”</p>

                <p>Sheryl smiled, feeling a warmth she couldn’t quite explain. “Anytime.”</p>

                <p>Two days later, as the storm finally cleared, Aiden was set to leave for Ireland. Sheryl met him near the campus gates to see him off, the early morning air cool and tinged with the faint scent of rain. His rucksack was slung over one shoulder, and despite his usual easy smile, there was a hint of nervousness in his eyes.</p>

                <p>“I’m glad the weather’s finally cooperating,” he said, breaking the silence, though his tone lacked its usual lightness.</p>

                <p>Sheryl nodded, her hands tucked into her jacket pockets. “It’ll be good for you to go home for a bit. Clear your head.”</p>

                <p>Aiden glanced at her, hesitating. “Yeah... I think I need this. To sort things out. With Ciara, I mean.”</p>

                <p>Sheryl forced a small smile, even as a pang of unease twisted in her chest. “I hope it works out. For both of you.”</p>

                <p>He studied her for a moment, his expression softening. “Thanks, Sheryl. For everything. I mean it.”</p>

                <p>She managed a nod, unsure if her voice would betray her if she tried to speak. As much as she wanted to wish him well, a part of her couldn’t shake the thought that things might not turn out the way he hoped.</p>

                <p>“Take care, Aiden,” she said finally, her voice steady. “Let me know when you’re back.”</p>

                <p>“I will,” he promised, offering her a warm smile before turning toward the waiting cab.</p>

                <p>With a mix of emotions flooding her, Sheryl turned the other way to walk towards the train station as she was heading to Cardiff for the rest of Easter.</p>
