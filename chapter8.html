                <h1 class="display-4">Chapter 8: Starcrossed Paths</h1>

                <p>The term had begun and so had Sheryl’s silent withdrawal from Aiden. She had overanalysed every possible reason why she had felt drawn to him from the moment he walked into class to why she needed to move away. There was an unspoken connection right from the start—one she didn’t realize he had felt too.</p>

                <p>She admired everything about him: his presence, his easy-going nature, how he handled everything calmly. No drama, no pretences, nothing superficial—just pure intentions and a quiet determination to build the life he wanted. It was rare to find someone so real in this fake world, and that made him stand out in a way she couldn’t ignore. From a distance, she observed him, fascinated by the way he carried himself.</p>
                
                <p>Then came the library interaction. The group projects. The late-night assignments where she helped him regain his focus. She saw his potential—knew he was brilliant, just a little lost. And though he never once led her on, she found herself falling for him anyway. Not because of words or gestures, but simply because of who he was.</p>
                
                <p>But reality had a way of reminding her where she stood. He wasn’t hers to love—he already had someone. And despite her best efforts to keep things normal, she couldn’t stop the feelings from creeping in. She could see through his actions she wasn’t the most important person in his life. He had other people who cared for him more. Was she really needed in his life? No. She had to accept the fact; it wasn’t about her being enough or not. It was his lack of emotional availability—his heart was already occupied. Too full for her to have any space there.</p>
                
                <p>Then, that phone call. She wasn’t sure if it was Ciara or someone else, but it was the sign she needed. A wake-up call.</p>
                
                <p>She had her own dreams, her own goals, and she refused to lose herself over something that was never meant to be. Resolute, she decided to step back. No more lingering in his orbit, no more making things easier for him. He would figure things out on his own—he needed to, and perhaps, it was for the best.</p>
                
                <p>Aiden had noticed it for weeks now—Sheryl pulling away, keeping her distance, her presence slowly fading from his days. At first, he convinced himself it was nothing, just a busy schedule, just life getting in the way. But after the trip, something had shifted. He felt it in the way she avoided his gaze, the way she chose different study spots, how she no longer lingered after class or responded as quickly to messages. It wasn’t just his imagination anymore.</p>
                
                <p>And now, sitting across from her at the student union café, he decided he couldn't ignore it any longer.</p>
                
                <p>"Why have you been so distant?" he asked, his voice calm but firm. "You’ve been nowhere to be seen lately. I need to talk to you."</p>
                
                <p>Sheryl barely looked up. She was seated at the table, flipping through her notes while absentmindedly taking a bite of her wrap. Chewing, she finally responded, her voice muffled, "Yeah, go ahead. What do you wanna talk about? If it’s about the assignment, Aiden, I’m sorry, but I haven’t even finished mine yet. What will I send you?"</p>
                
                <p>Aiden leaned forward, shaking his head. "No, it’s not about that. It’s just…" He hesitated for a second before continuing, searching for the right words. "After the trip, I felt it—something changed. Your energy, your vibe… It was like you were slipping away. And now, you actually are. You ignore me, you don’t talk like you used to, and I don’t get why."</p>
                
                <p>Sheryl froze for a moment. Her instinct was to deflect, to brush it off like it was nothing. Because if she let herself be honest, she would crack—she would tell him everything she had buried deep inside her heart.</p>
                
                <p>But what was the point?</p>
                
                <p>So instead, she forced a small shrug and replied, "I talk to no one, Aiden. I ignore everyone—it’s not just you. And I’ve always been like this. Nothing really changed after the trip." She exhaled, gathering her thoughts before continuing, her voice steady. "I made a decision. After coming back, I told myself I’d focus completely on my studies. Next year, I want to secure a summer internship—one that I told you about? That’s what matters to me right now."</p>
                
                <p>She glanced at him then, her expression unreadable. "And honestly, you should get a grip too. Stop fooling around and start applying for places. I know you’ll land something good, Aiden. You’re smart—you just need to put yourself out there."</p>
                
                <p>She checked the time and swiftly packed up her things. "We’re late for class. Stop fussing over this and let’s go."</p>
                
                <p>With that, she slung her bag over her shoulder, grabbed her trash from the table, tossed her empty coffee cup and wrap paper into the bin, and walked away.</p>
                
                <p>Aiden remained seated, staring after her, processing everything she had just said. Maybe she was right. Maybe she had always been like this, and he was the one reading too much into things. He let out a slow breath, turning her words over in his mind.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Cut to their final year.</strong></p>
                
                <p>Life had started falling into place for everyone.</p>
                
                <p>John had already secured a job before graduation. Hannah had landed a graduate role that would begin as soon as their course ended—her future all set. Gareth had decided to move back to his home country, ready to start a new chapter of his life.</p>
                
                <p>And Sheryl? She had landed a cybersecurity internship with one of the best firms in the UK. She was thrilled—it was exactly what she had worked so hard for.</p>
                
                <p>Aiden, too, had made his way. He secured an internship with a well-established software product company, one that had the potential to shape his future career.</p>
                
                <p>Aiden moved to Glasgow for his internship, immersing himself in his new role. Sheryl, on the other hand, worked remotely, only occasionally going into the office—but mostly, she stayed in Cardiff.</p>
                
                <p>Their worlds drifted apart, their once intertwined lives now running in completely different directions.</p>
                
                <p>One quiet evening, as rain drizzled softly against her window, Sheryl sat curled up with her diary and Tea. It had been a while since she had last written in it. Between meetings, deadlines, and the chaos of adulthood, her once-frequent habit had dwindled to occasional scribbles.</p>
                
                <p>Flipping through the pages, she found old quotes and random thoughts, and tucked between them—that poem.</p>
                
                <p>She traced the ink with her fingers, reading the words she had written long ago, words that still felt so painfully real.</p>
                
                <p><em>The way my heart betrays my will,<br>
                When I say I’m done, but think of you still.<br>
                It’s this constant fight of my brain and heart,<br>
                One telling me to let go, the other to hold on.<br>
                    <br>
                It’s in that deep voice of yours,<br>
                It’s the way happiness shines through those eyes of yours.<br>
                Oh, the way I see you,<br>
                If only anyone else did, they’d be in love for sure.<br>
                    <br>
                You are not my fictional man, though,<br>
                Not perfect, not easy, and  just not enough.<br>
                Then why do I keep circling back, you ask?<br>
                Even I don’t know, but it feels nothing less than love.</em></p>
                
                <p>She sighed, closing the diary and pressing it against her chest. <em>Why do I still feel this way?</em> It had been years. She had moved on—or at least, she had convinced herself she had.</p>
                
                <p>Just then, as if the universe had read her thoughts, her phone buzzed on the nightstand.</p>
                
                <p>She glanced at the screen.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Aiden.</strong></p>
                
                <p>The message flashed.</p>
                
                <p><em>"Hey Edris! Coming to Cardiff. Let’s ketchup."</em></p>
                
                <p>For a second, she just stared, her heart inexplicably skipping a beat.</p>
                
                <p>She rolled her eyes at his typo, a small, reluctant smile tugging at her lips.</p>
                
                <p><em>"It’s catch up, Aiden."</em> she replied.</p>
                
                <p>Her fingers hovered for a second before she added, <em>"You’re coming for Hannah’s wedding?"</em></p>
                
                <p>His response came almost immediately.</p>
                
                <p><em>"Yep! Feels like ages.. Hope to see you tomorrow at Nero's."</em></p>
                
                <p>Sheryl hesitated. Of course, she wanted to meet him. But something about seeing Aiden again after all these years made her stomach twist.</p>
                
                <p>Finally, she typed back: <em>"See you then."</em></p>

                <p>She locked her phone and exhaled deeply.</p>
                
                <p>Maybe it was just a coincidence. Maybe it meant nothing.</p>

                <p>But as she sat there, diary still in her lap, she couldn’t shake the feeling that no matter how much time passed, no matter how far life took them, their connection—silent and unspoken—still remained.</p>

                <p>She was both nervous and excited to meet Aiden after four years. Having stayed away from social media, she had almost forgotten what he looked like. Yet, she found herself eagerly anticipating their reunion.</p>
