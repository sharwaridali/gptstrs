                <h1 class="display-4">Chapter 9: Dawning</h1>
                <p>The next morning, the city was fresh after the early summer rain. Sunlight streamed through the damp streets, making Cardiff’s city centre glisten. The air smelled of rain and coffee, and the world buzzed with life.</p>

                <p>Sheryl walked towards Caffè Nero, her steps steady—until she saw those familiar ocean-green eyes. She almost stopped, gazing at him from afar.</p>
                
                <p>That’s what she noticed first. Always those eyes. Sharp, striking, effortlessly pulling attention. Even as he spoke on the video call, his expression was serious, his gaze held that quiet intensity that had always set him apart.</p>
                
                <p>Her eyes travelled, taking in the rest of him.</p>
                
                <p>Aiden was suited up in a dark gray ensemble—a shade between charcoal and slate—that fit him like it was tailored for his frame. The navy blue shirt underneath, neatly tucked in, added a sophisticated contrast. His beard had grown in just enough to make him look more mature, and his hair—perfectly styled, short on the sides, slightly tousled on top—made him look effortlessly put together.</p>
                
                <p>And then, as she took a step closer—his scent.</p>
                
                <p>It was so distinctly Aiden. That same familiar, clean, musky fragrance that she remembered from long ago. The kind that she remembered from wearing his jacket long back.</p>
                
                <p>Some things don’t change, she thought, almost smiling to herself.</p>
                
                <p>She finally closed the distance, sliding into a seat at the outdoor café table. Aiden noticed her immediately and tried to conclude the call as soon as possible.</p>
                
                <p>She simply smiled, waving him off, signalling that she didn’t mind.</p>
                
                <p>As she waited, she took in the way he held himself—one hand in his pocket, adorned with a sleek Omega that caught the light with every movement. The other was holding his phone, speaking in a composed, businesslike tone. So put together. So different from the boy who once skipped morning lectures without a second thought.</p>
                
                <p>Why so perfect, Mr. Wynne? She thought to herself in a daze.</p>
                
                <p>A few moments later, he ended the call and took the seat across from her, exhaling as he leaned back.</p>
                
                <p>Aiden's eyes twinkled as he glanced at her outfit. “Look at you! You’re giving off ‘Queen’ vibes. Looking all..” he said animatedly – “Lush”.</p>
                
                <p>She was wearing a light floral dress, with her hair just flowing behind her back. A nude lipstick shade for makeup. And her confidence. She had come to a firm decision: she would strictly stick to their friendship and not see Aiden more than that.</p>
                
                <p>Sheryl flipped her hair over her shoulder. “I prefer ‘mysterious woman who owns multiple businesses and might secretly be in the mafia.’”</p>
                
                <p>Aiden laughed. “Ah, so you are the boss lady now?”</p>
                
                <p>Sheryl raised an eyebrow. “Not yet. One day. What about you? Owning the business already?”</p>
                
                <p>Aiden smiled, “Not yet, but switched the company with a promotion. So, getting there one step at a time.”</p>
                
                <p>Sheryl congratulated him, and then they didn't know what to say. They ordered their Iced Lattes and fell back into their comfortable silence.</p>
                
                <p>And Gareth approached, beaming at them from a distance. He was impossible to miss—towering, broad-shouldered, and exuding the kind of rugged energy that made him look like he had just walked out of a Viking saga. His hair, slightly longer than before, was pushed back messily, giving him that barbarian-warrior-who-also-hacks-into-systems-for-fun kind of look. Dressed in a casual black hoodie over a plain tee, jeans, and combat boots, he looked like he belonged more in a dark hacker’s den than in the bright summer streets of Cardiff.</p>
                
                <p>But that was Gareth—part cyber wizard, part chaos.</p>
                
                <p>Gareth reached their table with his usual effortless swagger, patting Aiden firmly on the back as he dropped into the chair beside him. “Look at you, new company, new place, a promotion. What’s next, a personal assistant following you around?”</p>
                
                <p>Aiden smirked. “Give it a few months.”</p>
                
                <p>Gareth chuckled before nodding at Sheryl in greeting. “Mr. Wynne didn’t keep you waiting too long, did he?” Sheryl shook her head, sipping her coffee. “Nope, but he did try to flex the whole ‘busy businessman’ routine.”</p>
                
                <p>Gareth smirked, leaning back in his chair. “Flexing the businessman routine, huh? And here I thought you’d still be the guy submitting assignments at the last minute.”</p>
                
                <p>Aiden scoffed. “I wish. Those were the days, mate.”</p>
                
                <p>Gareth grinned before turning back to Sheryl. “What about you? Last, I remember you were into security—Red Team stuff, right?”</p>
                
                <p>Sheryl nodded, setting her cup down. “Yup, pentesting. Breaking into systems, proving security flaws—basically, legal chaos.”</p>
                
                <p>Gareth’s eyes lit up. “Ah, so you joined the dark side. Welcome to the game.”</p>
                
                <p>Aiden raised an eyebrow. “You two are literally on opposite teams.”</p>
                
                <p>Gareth shrugged. “Technically. But let’s be real: the Red Team and Blue Team need each other. Without people like her, security guys like me wouldn’t have jobs.”</p>
                
                <p>Sheryl smirked. “And without people like you patching things up, I wouldn’t get paid to break in again.”</p>
                
                <p>Gareth laughed. “See? A perfect cycle.”</p>
                
                <p>Aiden shook his head. “Yeah, yeah. You two keep playing hacker wars. Meanwhile, some of us work normal jobs without trying to dismantle the internet.”</p>
                
                <p>Sheryl grinned. “Where’s the fun in that?”</p>
                
                <p>Gareth clinked his coffee cup against hers. “Exactly.”</p>
                
                <p>Aiden leaned back in his chair, shaking his head as he watched Sheryl and Gareth get way too excited about their cyber talk.</p>
                
                <p>“Alright, that’s enough Cyber podcast for one morning,” he interrupted, waving a hand dismissively. “Before you two start speaking in binary, let’s talk about something that actually matters—like getting to Tenby.”</p>
                
                <p>“John will meet us there directly, so I figured I’d drive down this afternoon. Gareth’s already joining in. So, Sheryl… it’d be nice if you also came along?”</p>
                
                <p>Gareth stretched lazily. “A fancy car ride? Tempting.”</p>
                
                <p>Aiden added. “Plus, Hannah would be relieved to know we’re all there early, settled in before the madness begins. The wedding’s tomorrow, and you know how she gets.”</p>
                
                <p>Sheryl chuckled. “True. She’s probably already stressing about last-minute details. Alright, I’m in. When are we leaving?”</p>
                
                <p>“Late Afternoon around half past 3 or max 4."Aiden rolled his eyes "I swear, it’s going to be a long drive.”</p>
                
                <p>But even as he said it, a part of him felt something he hadn’t expected: relief. Seeing Sheryl here, with them, felt oddly right. She had changed, but not entirely. The core of who she was remained—the sharp wit, the quiet strength—but there was something different now. She carried herself with more confidence, more ease, no longer the girl who kept the world at arm’s length.</p>
                
                <p>It had been four years since college, but in truth, it was five years since they’d had a real conversation. She had slowly drifted away from him, pulling back, creating distance until their bond had faded into something unspoken, uncertain. He had thought he’d lost her for good.</p>
                
                <p>And yet, here they were after ages.</p>
                
                <p>They piled into the car—Gareth in the passenger seat, Aiden behind the wheel, and Sheryl settling into the back.</p>

                <p>As they pulled onto the road, Aiden glanced at the rearview mirror. His eyes landed on Sheryl. She didn’t look lost this time. There was something lighter about her, an energy that felt… settled. Excited, even. Maybe for the wedding, for Hannah.</p>

                <p>Sheryl watched the landscape blur past the window, thinking to herself how happy she felt today. Maybe she was excited for the wedding, finally seeing Hannah as a bride. But deep down her heart was happy being around Aiden again, but she refused to accept it.</p>

                <p>The ride was mostly filled with Gareth’s questionable playlist—one moment, it was 2000s rock anthems, the next, some obscure synthwave track none of them recognized.</p>

                <p>“Mate, what even is this?” Aiden groaned as an oddly futuristic beat played through the speakers.</p>

                <p>“Art,” Gareth replied smugly, turning the volume up.</p>

                <p>Sheryl chuckled from the backseat. “I actually like it.”</p>

                <p>Aiden shot her a playful glare through the rearview mirror. “Traitor.”</p>

                <p>Sheryl shook her head with a small smile before the car fell into a comfortable silence, the sound of the road humming beneath them as they neared Swansea.</p>

                <p>All of them shifting to their memories of the place.</p>

                <p>“Do you ever think about how different life would’ve been if we’d made different choices?”</p>

                <p>Aiden didn’t miss a beat. “Well, Cyber Queen of Mayhem, if you’re trying to recruit me to the dark side, just say it.”</p>

                <p>Sheryl sighed, shaking her head. “You are impossible.”</p>

                <p>Gareth chuckled. “She’s got a point, though. Ever think about that, mate?”</p>

                <p>Aiden smirked, eyes still on the road. “I try not to. I like to believe we end up where we’re meant to be.”</p>

                <p>Sheryl hummed, looking back out the window. “Yeah… maybe.”</p>

                <p>As they pulled into Tenby, the coastal town bathed in the golden hues of the late afternoon sun, they spotted John already waiting for them near the hotel entrance.</p>

                <p>The moment Aiden stepped out of the car, John was on him, pulling him into a tight, excited hug. “Look who finally decided to show up!” he grinned, giving Aiden a hearty slap on the back.</p>

                <p>Gareth stepped forward next, and John immediately switched to that classic, effortless boys’ handshake—firm grip, a pull-in, and a pat on the back. “Brother,” John greeted with a nod, his grin widening.</p>

                <p>Then his gaze landed on Sheryl. His expression softened slightly, the playful energy giving way to something warmer. He extended a hand to her, offering a firm yet warm handshake, paired with an easy, genuine smile. “Sheryl,” he said, as if acknowledging the years that had passed, but also the familiarity that remained.</p>

                <p>She returned the smile, shaking his hand. “John. It’s good to see you.”</p>

                <p>John had bulked up a little, his frame broader than before, carrying himself with the ease of someone who had grown into his own. There was a different air about him now—a certain confidence, the kind that came with experience. He had the vibe of a corporate manager, but his outfit told a different story. Dressed in a relaxed linen shirt and trousers, he looked effortlessly put together, exuding the kind of ease that only came from success without the stress.</p>

                <p>He had flown in from Jamaica. Business was his world now, and from the way he carried himself, it was clear he was thriving.</p>

                <p>As he greeted each of them, there was no trace of formality, just the same old John—except a little sharper, a little more refined, but still the same at heart.</p>

                <p>The four of them made their way toward the venue where Hannah was getting last-minute preparations done. The moment they stepped in, she turned, her face lighting up with pure joy as she saw them.</p>

                <p>Hannah had always been beautiful, but today, she looked radiant. Her long, chestnut-brown hair was styled in soft waves, framing her delicate features. Her eyes sparkled with excitement, her natural warmth shining through. Dressed in a simple yet elegant ivory dress for the pre-wedding gathering, she carried herself with grace—poised but still very much the Hannah they all knew.</p>

                <p>“You guys finally made it!” she beamed, rushing toward them.</p>

                <p>Aiden was the first to hug her, lifting her slightly off the ground. “Of course, we did. Couldn’t let you have all the fun without us.”</p>

                <p>Gareth and John followed, offering their congratulations, and then she turned to Sheryl, pulling her into a tight hug. “It’s been too long.”</p>

                <p>Sheryl smiled. “It really has.”</p>

                <p>After a moment, Hannah stepped back and turned toward the tall man standing beside her. His presence was steady, his expression calm yet kind. He had short dark hair and a well-kept beard and carried himself with quiet confidence.</p>

                <p>“This is my fiancé, Theo,” she introduced, her voice filled with pride and happiness.</p>

                <p>Theo extended his hand, his grip firm yet warm as he greeted each of them. “It’s great to finally meet you all. I’ve heard way too many stories.”</p>

                <p>Aiden smirked. “All good things, I hope?”</p>

                <p>Hannah shot him a knowing look. “Debatable.”</p>

                <p>The wedding was set for tomorrow morning, but tonight was reserved for a quiet, intimate dinner by the beach—just close friends and family, laughter mingling with the ocean breeze.</p>

                <p>After the food and drinks had settled, the group found themselves lounging on the patio outside the beachside villa, enjoying the sound of the waves rolling in the distance. Gareth, John, Sheryl, and Hannah sat in a small circle, reminiscing about old times when Hannah clapped her hands together excitedly.</p>

                <p>“I have an idea,” she announced, sitting up straighter. “I want to try on my dress once before tomorrow. And while I’m at it, I need opinions—should I go with a traditional veil or something softer?”</p>

                <p>John grinned. “Ah, the pre-wedding dress rehearsal. Classic.”</p>

                <p>Hannah rolled her eyes. “I just need honest opinions, okay?”</p>

                <p>She stood up, grabbing Sheryl’s hand. “Come with me?”</p>

                <p>Sheryl nodded, but just as she started toward the villa with Hannah, her steps slowed. Out of the corner of her eye, she caught Aiden.</p>

                <p>He was leaning slightly against the railing, casually sipping his drink, but his attention was on Camille.</p>

                <p>Sheryl recognized the look instantly, the teasing smirk, the way his body language shifted ever so slightly forward, engaged. Camille, in return, was blushing, twirling a strand of her hair around her fingers, clearly enjoying the attention.</p>

                <p>It was nothing serious. Just casual flirting. Aiden being Aiden.</p>

                <p>Still… something about it made Sheryl’s stomach twist. She exhaled sharply and turned away, silently following Hannah inside.</p>

                <p>Aiden arrived back at the group not long after, sliding into one of the lounge chairs. “Where’s Hannah and Sheryl?”</p>

                <p>Hannah, now stepping back onto the patio in her wedding dress, momentarily stole everyone’s breath. The gown was simple yet stunning, hugging her frame perfectly, the delicate lace catching the soft golden glow of the string lights.</p>

                <p>“Damn,” Gareth muttered. “Theo might just pass out tomorrow.”</p>

                <p>Aiden grinned. “You look incredible, Han.”</p>

                <p>Hannah smiled. “Thanks.” Then, almost offhandedly, she added, “Sheryl decided to call it a night. Just a little worn out.”</p>

                <p>John, who had been watching quietly, glanced between Hannah and Aiden before shifting his gaze fully to Aiden.</p>

                <p>Aiden caught the look and frowned. “What?”</p>

                <p>Hannah hesitated for a beat. Then, with a small shake of her head, she sighed. “Nothing. Don’t worry about it.”</p>

                <p>John and Gareth exchanged a glance before standing.</p>

                <p>“Alright, mate,” John announced. “Let’s go grab a drink.”</p>

                <p>“Yeah,” Gareth added. “Let the girls have their moment.”</p>

                <p>Aiden, still perplexed, watched as they practically dragged him away, leaving Hannah shaking her head behind them.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, in Hannah’s room, Sheryl stared at her reflection in the mirror, her heart heavy. She had spent years convincing herself that her feelings for Aiden had faded, that they had been nothing more than a youthful attachment. But seeing him again, hearing his voice, catching those fleeting moments of familiarity—it had unravelled everything she had neatly tucked away.</p>

                <p>Tomorrow was Hannah’s wedding. This was a celebration. She wouldn’t let these old emotions cloud the happiness of the moment.</p>

                <p>So, with a deep breath, she straightened her posture and wiped away any lingering doubt from her face.</p>

                <p>She saw Hannah approach. “You look breathtaking, Han,” she said quickly, her voice steady despite the lump in her throat. “The traditional veil would go perfectly with your dress. Classic and elegant.”</p>

                <p>Hannah didn’t even glance at the veil. Instead, she walked over and sat beside her, placing a gentle hand on her arm. “You don’t have to pretend with me, you know.”</p>

                <p>Sheryl let out a quiet laugh, shaking her head as she looked down at her hands. “There’s no point, Han.” She exhaled slowly. “I’m just… not a part of his life anymore. Our ways drifted apart so much that I didn’t even know what was happening with him until yesterday when we met. And that’s okay. I get it.”</p>

                <p>She swallowed hard before continuing. “I just… I need to stick to my decision—strictly keeping it friendly. Nothing more. That’s the smart thing to do. I don’t even know why I reacted this way. I shouldn’t have. And I’m sorry if I spoiled your mood.”</p>

                <p>Hannah shook her head, squeezing her hand. “No, girl, you didn’t. And I know why you reacted that way.” She looked at her knowingly. “You still love him.”</p>

                <p>Sheryl’s lips parted slightly, but no words came out.</p>

                <p>Hannah continued, “Don’t keep it bottled up. At least let him know, just once. Whatever happens after that… at least you won’t have to wonder.”</p>

                <p>Sheryl inhaled sharply, shaking her head. “It won’t change anything, Han. It won’t be of any use. I don’t want to mess things up. And it’s your day, so let’s celebrate you!”</p>

                <p>Hannah studied her for a moment, then simply smiled. “Alright.”</p>

                <p>John sighed, shaking his head with a knowing smirk. "Mate… she clearly liked you. At least back then"</p>

                <p>Aiden frowned, confused.</p>

                <p>John leaned forward slightly. "You never saw it, did you? The eyes, Chico, they never lie.. I caught her writing a poem in class once— I didn’t mean to snoop, but I glanced over before she snapped the diary shut the second she realized I was there.” He chuckled, shaking his head. “Didn’t read it all, but mate… how many times do you find someone who writes poems about you?”</p>

                <p>Aiden blinked. "Wait, wait—who did what now? And who's this Chico?"</p>

                <p>Gareth, looking almost exasperated at Aiden’s sheer cluelessness, scoffed. "You are Chiko, and Sheryl, you idiot. The way she looks at you, anyone could tell."</p>

                <p>And then—everything dawned on him.</p>

                <p>"Oh…"</p>

                <p>It hit like a delayed punch to the gut. He had never thought about it, never connected the dots. Not really. But now, with everything piecing together, the memories rushed back—the way she had been around him back then, the distance she created later, and the things left unsaid.</p>

                <p>John and Gareth exchanged a glance. Finally, he gets it.</p>

                <p>Aiden exhaled, rubbing his jaw. “Well… shit.”</p>
