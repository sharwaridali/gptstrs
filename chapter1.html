                <p>The waves lapped gently against the shoreline, their rhythm steady and soothing, as Aiden sat alone on the soft sands. His arms were loosely wrapped around his knees, his face serene yet lost in thoughts. The sky was painted in fiery hues of orange and pink, the sun dipping lower with every passing moment, casting a warm glow across the water. It was his birthday, but for Aiden, the quiet solitude of the beach felt like the perfect place to reflect.</p>

                <p>Sheryl spotted him from a distance, his figure unmistakable against the glowing horizon. She had a small box tucked under her arm, its ribbon barely holding against the wind as she approached. Her footsteps slowed when she saw him like this—calm, untethered, the Aiden she adored the most. She hesitated for a moment, savoring the sight of him, before softly walking closer.</p>

                <p>“You’re hiding,” she said gently, her voice breaking the stillness.</p>

                <p>Aiden glanced up, the corner of his mouth curving into a faint smile. “Not hiding. Just… thinking.”</p>

                <p>Sheryl sank onto the sand beside him, keeping some space between the two. “Thinking about what? Don’t tell me you’re brooding on your birthday.”</p>

                <p>He chuckled, low and soft. “Not brooding. Just… enjoying the quiet. It’s nice here.”</p>

                <p>She tilted her head, looking out at the horizon. The sun was almost gone, the colors deepening to crimson and gold. The world seemed to hold its breath, waiting for the stars to take over. Sheryl wrapped her arms around her knees, mimicking his posture, and let the stillness linger for a while.</p>

                <p>Finally, she broke the silence, her voice warm with awe. “The sunset is beautiful, isn’t it?”</p>

                <p>Aiden turned his head slightly, his gaze lingering on her instead of the horizon. A soft breeze ruffled her hair, and the colors of the sunset reflected in her eyes. His lips twitched into the faintest of smiles, one so fleeting it almost went unnoticed.</p>

                <p>“The moon is looking beautiful,” he murmured, his voice quiet but resolute.</p>

                <p>Sheryl blinked, caught off guard, and turned to follow his gaze. But the moon had only just risen, faint against the dusky sky, its light pale and unassuming compared to the vibrant sunset. She looked back at him, confusion flickering across her face, but he didn’t elaborate.</p>

                <p>Aiden’s expression softened, his eyes distant yet full of something she couldn’t quite place. The silence stretched between them, the sound of the waves filling the space where words might have been.</p>

                <p>The sun disappeared entirely, leaving only the moon to light their world.</p>
