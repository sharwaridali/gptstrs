                <h1 class="display-4">Chapter 7: Breaking Currents</h1>

                    <p>They reached the car park where Hannah and Gareth were already waiting by the car, stretching their limbs after sitting for hours. John stood nearby, checking his phone.</p>

                    <p>Aiden caught up moments later, shoving his phone into his pocket as he approached. Sheryl glanced at him but didn’t ask. Instead, without a word, she quietly held his jacket out for him.</p>

                    <p>Aiden hesitated, then took it from her, their fingers barely brushing. “Cheers,” he murmured.</p>

                    <p>She nodded, saying nothing.</p>

                    <p>They all piled into the car, exhaustion settling over them like a heavy blanket. The drive back to their BnB was quiet, the only sounds the faint hum of the engine and the distant crash of waves against the cliffs.</p>

                    <p>The next morning, the house stirred to life slowly. No alarms, no set plans—just the last few hours of their trip ticking away lazily.</p>

                    <p>Sheryl spent some time alone on the balcony, wrapped in a light cardigan, sipping tea as she watched the waves in the distance. The silence around her only amplified the noise in her mind, each unspoken thought growing louder in the absence of distraction. With nothing to drown them out—no conversation, no music, no movement—her thoughts tangled and twisted, demanding her attention. It was the kind of stillness that didn’t bring peace but rather made her hyper-aware of everything she had been trying to push aside. She felt like running away leaving behind everything.</p>

                    <p>Meanwhile, Aiden sat outside on the garden steps, staring absently at his phone before locking the screen and setting it aside.</p>

                    <p>They all did their own thing—Hannah journaling in the living room, Gareth taking his time packing, John chatting with the Airbnb owner about local spots they hadn’t gotten around to visiting.</p>

                    <p>By afternoon, they were back on the road, heading for Swansea.</p>

                    <p>The car ride was quieter this time. Less energetic than the journey there, the weight of the past few days settling over them in a pleasant kind of exhaustion.</p>

                    <p>John drove, Aiden beside him in the passenger seat, while Gareth, Hannah, and Sheryl sat in the back.</p>

                    <p>Hannah had fallen asleep within minutes, Gareth, sitting at the window, had his headphones in, eyes closed, fingers tapping against his knee in rhythm with a song only he could hear.</p>

                    <p>Sheryl, looking out the other window, stared outside, letting the breeze make her thoughts flow wild. This quiet, creeping sense of losing Aiden shouldn’t have unsettled her so much. And yet, it did—in ways she couldn’t quite understand, let alone explain to herself.</p>

                    <p>She had always been careful. Always guarded. Because she had learned too early that the world was not as kind as her home had once led her to believe.</p>

                    <p>Her family had been her safe haven, a place where love was unconditional. But school had shown her a different reality—one where loyalty was fragile, and kindness was rarely rewarded. She had once stood up against her friends for their wrong doing, and it had cost her everything. Friendships shattered. Bonds broken. One moment of courage had left her abandoned, and no one had cared enough to stand beside her.</p>

                    <p>After that, she had stopped trying.</p>

                    <p>She withdrew, let her walls rise higher, let books become her closest companions. She kept her world small, because small meant safe.</p>

                    <p>She only left this safe place to accomplish her dreams. She had stepped into a world where friendships still felt superficial, where she was always just on the outside looking in.</p>

                    <p>And somehow—against all reason, against all the walls she had carefully built—she had let Aiden in.</p>

                    <p>Why?</p>

                    <p>Why had she lowered her guard for him?</p>

                    <p>Her heart, the one she had trained to be cautious, had betrayed her.</p>

                    <p>She didn’t feel like sleeping. She didn’t feel like listening to music. She just… sat there completely lost, in the quiet hum of the car, in the fading warmth of Cornwall behind them.</p>

                    <p>From the front seat, Aiden glanced up at the rearview mirror.</p>

                    <p>His gaze found her—Sheryl, sitting still, eyes fixed on the world outside, completely lost in something unspoken.</p>

                    <p>A strange feeling crept up on him.</p>

                    <p>Something about the way she looked—so far away, yet right there—made him stare for a moment longer and he felt the energy shift between them.</p>

                    <p>She didn’t notice.</p>

                    <p>She was elsewhere, caught in a trance, in thoughts he couldn’t reach.</p>

                    <p>Aiden blinked, forcing himself to look away, turning his attention back to the road ahead.</p>

                    <p>But the feeling lingered.</p>

                    <p><strong>Drifting Away</strong></p>

                    <p>By the time they reached Swansea, the city was cloaked in the quiet stillness of the late night. Streetlights flickered against the damp roads, and the familiar hum of distant traffic replaced the endless stretch of the Cornish coastline.</p>

                    <p>The car rumbled to a stop in front of Hannah’s accommodation. She stirred awake, mumbling a sleepy goodbye before stepping out. Gareth, barely lifting his head from where he had been resting against the window, gave a lazy wave and followed suit.</p>

                    <p>That left just John, Sheryl and Aiden.</p>

                    <p>John, still in the driver’s seat, yawned. “Alright, next stop—Sheryl’s.”</p>

                    <p>The ride to her place was short, but the silence between them made it feel longer. When the car finally pulled up, Sheryl unbuckled her seatbelt, Aiden got her bag. She didn’t look at Aiden right away, just exhaled softly and took her bag from him. There was no lingering goodbye, no small talk.</p>

                    <p>She simply offered them a small, sly smile, one that didn’t quite reach her eyes, and murmured, “See you.”</p>

                    <p>And disappeared into the dimly lit path leading to her accommodation.</p>

                    <p>Aiden stood there for a while longer before getting in the car. Looking in her direction, at the fading glimpse of her silhouette before she vanished behind the door.</p>

                    <p>And in that moment, he felt it.</p>

                    <p>That strange connection—the one that had formed between them over months of working together on projects and assignments, quiet conversations, and things they never quite said aloud.</p>

                    <p>They never needed words. And this time, the connection told him he was about to lose a friend, and he didn’t understand why.</p>

                    <p>She was pulling away.</p>

                    <p>Maybe not physically, maybe not immediately, but she was moving far, far away from him.</p>

                    <p>Aiden exhaled slowly, his fingers drumming against his knee as he finally got back into the car.</p>

                    <p>John, sensing Aiden’s hesitation, let out a sleepy sigh as he started driving again. “Everyone must be exhausted. Let’s just rest up before term starts. A whole new year ahead, new stuff coming.”</p>

                    <p>Aiden nodded absentmindedly, but his mind was elsewhere.</p>

                    <p>By the time they reached his accommodation, the city was eerily quiet, the kind of stillness that felt heavier than it should. He muttered a thanks to John, shut the car door, and stood outside with his bag for a moment, watching as the taillights disappeared down the road.</p>

                    <p>There was a lot to look forward to in the new academic year.</p>

                    <p>New projects. New challenges.</p>

                    <p>New… everything.</p>

                    <p>But tonight, his mind wasn’t on that. It was on the phone call he had received at the Minack Theatre.</p>

                    <p>His friend hadn’t even let him say hello before blurting out—Ciara had met with an accident.</p>

                    <p>Aiden had barely managed to say "Ciara.." before stepping away from Sheryl to take the call. His heart had dropped, shock settling in like a heavy weight in his chest. But after those first few seconds, after the initial disbelief… </p>
                    
                    <p>There was nothing.</p>

                    <p>She was recovering in the hospital, and he had wished her well. That was all.</p>

                    <p>Was he going to freak out and rush to see her? Take care of her? No.</p>

                    <p>Because she wasn’t his to worry about anymore.</p>

                    <p>There had been a time when he would have dropped everything. But now? Now, she wasn’t his friend, wasn’t his girlfriend, wasn’t anything. Just someone who existed in a part of his life that didn’t belong to him anymore.</p>

                    <p>He hoped she healed, that she had people who cared for her. But it wasn’t his place to be one of them.</p>

                    <p>And that realization didn’t hurt.</p>

                    <p>Aiden shut his door, tossing his keys onto his desk before sinking into his bed. His mind was restless, but not because of Ciara.</p>

                    <p>Instead, his thoughts drifted to Sheryl.</p>

                    <p>Sheryl, who had unknowingly helped him.</p>

                    <p>Not just with assignments and projects, not just with getting his career back on track. But move on from a relationship where he never truly belonged. Ciara was a good person, but they were never meant for each other. Their paths, their wants—none of it aligned. It had taken him time to accept that, but in the end, letting go had been the only choice.</p>

                    <p>And it was being around Sheryl that had made him see it clearly.</p>

                    <p>Somehow, she had grounded him, helped him focus, move forward, and why he was headed to where he was headed - in his life. For the first time, he knew exactly what he wanted.</p>

                    <p>Her mere presence was strong. Her energy contagious.</p>

                    <p>She was a book nerd, yet witty. Outgoing, yet reserved. A friend to many, yet close to few or maybe none. Always helping, always looking out for others, yet never fully letting anyone in.</p>

                    <p>It was almost surprising that she had agreed to come on this trip at all.</p>

                    <p>But she had.</p>

                    <p>And Aiden had been glad to see her step out of her bubble.</p>

                    <p>He had seen a different Sheryl in Cornwall.</p>

                    <p>She could surf—not perfect, but better than him, which was impressive.</p>

                    <p>She had knowledge beyond just studies—random facts, sharp observations, thoughtful perspectives.</p>

                    <p>She wasn’t just an academic prodigy. She was fun. Bold. Someone worth knowing.</p>

                    <p>Aiden liked her energy, liked being around her.</p>

                    <p>He never said it. Never felt the need to.</p>

                    <p>But tonight, as he lay there staring at the ceiling, he wondered if maybe—just maybe—she was pulling away from him, the same way she did with everyone else, quietly setting boundaries.</p>

                    <p>And that’s when it hit him—she had let him in by choice. She had lowered her guard for him, when she never did for anyone else.</p>

                    <p>But why? He wanted to know. Understand her better. He had to talk to her. The unspoken connection and understanding weren’t helping now.</p>

                    <p>That thought lingered as his eyelids grew heavy, and before he could make sense of it all—he drifted off to sleep.</p>
