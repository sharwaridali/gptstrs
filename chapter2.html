            <h1 class="display-4">Chapter 2: The Eclipse</h1>
            <p>As the evening sky darkened, Sheryl’s memory deepened,</p>
            <p>Of days gone by when their paths first leapt and steepened.</p>

            <p>The Swansea University campus buzzed with the energy of fresh starts and new beginnings. It was a melting pot of excitement and nervous anticipation as students from all walks of life settled into their routines. For Sheryl, the transition had been cautious but steady. She wasn’t one to dive into social circles; instead, she found comfort in exploring the campus, discovering the quiet corners of the library, and keeping to herself.</p>

            <p>Aiden's start, however, was a stark contrast. Hailing from Ireland with his warm charisma and easy laughter, he seemed to slot effortlessly into the hustle and bustle of university life. Within days, he’d formed a tight-knit group of friends and could often be found in the centre of a crowd, his voice animated as he regaled them with stories.</p>

            <p>For weeks, their paths ran parallel but never crossed. Sheryl’s quiet observations of Aiden, glimpses of him during lectures or at student events, remained just that—distant. She told herself it was nothing more than curiosity. He was, after all, the kind of person who belonged in the spotlight, whereas she was more comfortable in the shadows. Little did she know that their lives were set to intertwine in ways she could never have anticipated.</p>

            <p>The Uni campus was shrouded in the familiar grey of an overcast Welsh morning. The relentless hum of activity filled the halls as students hurried between lectures, clutching notebooks and takeaway coffee cups. The first year of university had been a whirlwind for Sheryl. Settling into the rhythm of a new life away from home had been both daunting and exhilarating. But now, with final exams looming, the atmosphere on campus had shifted. The usual carefree chatter was replaced by whispered conversations about coursework and revision strategies.</p>

            <p>Sheryl adjusted her bag strap and glanced around the packed library. The air was thick with the smell of paper, ink, and a faint trace of coffee. She loved this place. It was her refuge, a corner of the chaotic world where she could disappear into the comforting silence. As she wove between the rows of desks, her eyes caught a familiar figure slumped in one of the chairs near the back. Aiden.</p>

            <p>Even though they were in the same Computer Science course, Sheryl and Aiden had never exchanged more than the occasional polite nod. Recently, however, she’d noticed something different about him. Over the past few weeks, he had grown quieter. The laughter that usually surrounded him had faded, and the circle of friends he was always seen with now seemed to orbit without him. Sheryl had noticed the shift, though she’d never given herself the permission to think about it too much. After all, what did she know about Aiden’s life?</p>

            <p>That morning, however, it was impossible to ignore. Aiden sat at the desk, his shoulders hunched, his phone pressed against his ear. His face was pale, his free hand clenched into a fist on the table. Sheryl hesitated, feeling like she was intruding on something private, but before she could move on, his voice stopped her in her tracks.</p>

            <p>“Please, Ciara, I… I don’t understand. Can we not talk about this?” His voice cracked slightly, the Irish cadence roughened by emotion.</p>

            <p>Sheryl’s heart clenched. She quickly moved to the next row of desks, sitting down just out of sight. She didn’t want to eavesdrop, but it was hard not to hear the strain in his voice.</p>

            <p>“I know I messed up, but we can work through this, yeah? Please, just don’t… don’t do this.” A long pause followed, broken only by the faint sound of a female voice on the other end of the line. Whatever Ciara was saying, it wasn’t what Aiden wanted to hear.</p>

            <p>“Right. Fine,” he said abruptly, his tone sharp now, though the hurt was unmistakable. “If that’s what you want.”</p>

            <p>The call ended with a quiet, defeated sigh. Sheryl, unsure of what to do, fiddled with her pen and stared at the open laptop in front of her. Aiden stayed where he was, his head bowed, his fingers running through his hair. The sight of him, so obviously broken, stirred something in her.</p>

            <p>Before she could talk herself out of it, she stood and walked over to his table.</p>

            <p>“Hi,” she said softly, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>

            <p>Aiden looked up, his green eyes rimmed with redness. For a moment, he seemed surprised to see her.</p>

            <p>“Oh, hi,” he said, clearing his throat and straightening in his chair. He glanced at her, then back at the phone in his hand. “Erm, sorry about that. Didn’t mean to…, you know, disrupt anyone.”</p>

            <p>“You didn’t,” Sheryl replied quickly. “I just… I noticed you seemed upset. Are you… is everything okay?”</p>

            <p>He gave her a hollow smile. “Not really, no.”</p>

            <p>There was an awkward pause. Sheryl’s instinct was to retreat, to apologise for intruding and leave him to his thoughts, but something held her in place.</p>

            <p>“Do you want to talk about it?” she asked tentatively.</p>

            <p>Aiden blinked at her, as though the idea of someone caring enough to ask had caught him off guard. He hesitated, then gestured to the chair opposite him.</p>

            <p>“I guess I’ve got nothing to lose.”</p>

            <p>Sheryl sat down, her hands clasped nervously on the table. She wasn’t sure what to say, but she figured listening was a good start.</p>

            <p>“It’s Ciara,” Aiden began, his voice heavy. “My girlfriend… well, ex-girlfriend now, I suppose. She’s… she’s had enough of me.” He let out a bitter laugh. “Can’t really blame her, though. I’ve not exactly been the easiest person to be around lately.”</p>

            <p>Sheryl frowned. “Why would you say that?”</p>

            <p>Aiden shrugged. “I’ve been struggling, you know? With the course, with being away from home. I thought I was handling it all right, but clearly not. She said she felt like I was shutting her out.” He rubbed his eyes with the heel of his hand. “Guess she decided it wasn’t worth sticking around.”</p>

            <p>Sheryl’s heart ached for him. She knew what it felt like to struggle in silence, to carry burdens you weren’t sure how to share.</p>

            <p>“I’m sorry,” she said softly. “Breakups are hard.”</p>

            <p>Aiden nodded, staring at the table. “Yeah, they are. But, you know, life goes on, doesn’t it? Can’t sit around feeling sorry for myself forever. Exams are coming up, and I’ve got to pull myself together.”</p>

            <p>Sheryl smiled faintly. “That’s true. But it’s okay to take a bit of time to feel rubbish about it, too.”</p>

            <p>For the first time that day, Aiden’s lips twitched into something resembling a genuine smile. “Thanks, Sheryl.” He paused, then added, “I… I don’t think I’ve ever properly spoken to you before. I’ve seen you around, though. You’re always in the library, aren’t you?”</p>

            <p>Sheryl laughed lightly, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. “Yeah, I guess I spend more time here than anywhere else. It’s quiet, and you can actually think.”</p>

            <p>Aiden nodded, leaning back in his chair. “Makes sense. It’s funny, though. I’ve been in the same course as you for months now, and I don’t think I’ve ever really noticed just how much you... well, keep to yourself. Doesn’t it get lonely?”</p>
            <p>Sheryl hesitated. The question caught her off guard, not because it wasn’t true, but because no one had ever asked her that before. “Sometimes,” she admitted after a moment.</p>

            <p>“But I don’t mind it, really. I like observing people, you know? Seeing how they interact, understanding them from a distance. It’s... easier.” 
                Aiden tilted his head, his eyes studying her in a way that felt unfamiliar yet oddly comforting. “I think I get that,” he said thoughtfully. “But you can’t always stay on the outside looking in, you know?”</p>
            
            <p>Sheryl smiled faintly. “Maybe., but I feel safe". For a while, neither of them said anything.</p>

            <p>The faint hum of the library filled the silence, and Sheryl found herself strangely at ease sitting there with him. She wasn’t sure how long they stayed like that, but eventually, Aiden broke the quiet.</p>

            <p>“You’re easy to talk to,” he said, his voice softer now. “Thanks for... just sitting here. Listening.”

                Sheryl glanced at him and felt her cheeks warm. “I didn’t do much.”</p>

            <p>“You did more than you think,” Aiden replied. He gave her a small, genuine smile. “Maybe we should do this again sometime. You know, if I don’t see you glued to your laptop first.”

                Sheryl chuckled, a flicker of something light and hopeful sparking inside her. “Maybe.”</p>

            <p>Aiden picked up his bag, slinging it over his shoulder. “Well, I should get going. Thanks again, Sheryl. Really.”</p>

            <p>She nodded, watching as he walked away, his figure disappearing into the maze of bookshelves. A strange mix of emotions churned within her—curiosity, a cautious sense of connection, and the faintest hint of something she couldn’t quite name.</p>

            <p>As she turned back to her laptop, her fingers hesitated over the keyboard. For the first time in a long while, the words and numbers on the screen felt less important than the memory of Aiden’s smile as he walked away.
            </p>

            <p>What she didn’t know yet was that this small moment was a start to their friendship.</p>
