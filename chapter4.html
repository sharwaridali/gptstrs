                <h1 class="display-4">Chapter 4: Sky full of Stars</h1>
                <p>The class felt different without him, even though nothing about the course itself had changed. Aiden had texted that he’d be arriving a day late after the term started, taking a lazy day off to recover from travel. His absence left a void that felt strangely significant, like a song played without its melody.</p>

                <p>Sheryl caught herself glancing at his usual seat during lectures, a quiet ache curling in her chest each time she saw it empty. It was ridiculous, really. Why should it matter so much? She told herself it was because Aiden had a way of lighting up the room, his laughter and banter weaving threads of energy through the monotony of their days. But even as she tried to rationalize it, a part of her knew better. She had grown used to him — his kindness, his quick wit, the moments they shared, whether studying or talking about nothing in particular.</p>

                <p>When Aiden returned the next day, Sheryl couldn’t help but stare as he walked into the room, a sense of relief washing over her as though everything was suddenly right again. By the afternoon, his energy had returned in full force — his voice carried across the group, his laughter contagious, his charm pulling everyone back into orbit around him. He blended in seamlessly, as if he had never been away, and Sheryl felt the warmth of his presence more acutely than ever.</p>

                <p>To her surprise, Aiden pulled her into the group dynamic with ease, including her in jokes and conversations with his natural charm. Sheryl didn’t know if it was their growing friendship or simply who he was, but she found herself spending more time with the group. Aiden seemed genuinely happy, occasionally distracted by his phone, and she assumed he had patched things up with Ciara over the break. The thought was bittersweet. Seeing him happy made her happy — how could it not? But there was an ache beneath her joy, a longing she couldn’t quite suppress.</p>

                <p>As the summer term wound down, the buzz about the annual Summer Ball consumed the campus. The grand masked party promised an evening of glamour, music, and laughter, and everyone scrambled to find a date. Sheryl noticed how easily others paired up, excitement filling their conversations. But she didn’t ask anyone, and no one asked her.</p>

                <p>Aiden, too, seemed uninterested. When one of the guys jokingly asked about his plans, he shrugged and said he wasn’t going to bother finding a date. “I’ll come to the party, sure,” he said casually.</p>

                <p>Sheryl had considered asking him — just as friends — but the thought of Ciara loomed large in her mind. Assuming he and Ciara had rekindled their relationship, she didn’t want to cause trouble.</p>

                <p>The evening of the ball arrived, and the campus transformed into a dreamscape. Twinkling lights hung between trees, the faint strains of a live band drifted through the air, and students dressed in elegant gowns and sharp suits floated through the venue, their masks adding an air of mystery.</p>

                <p>Sheryl had chosen a flowing emerald dress that shimmered under the lights, her delicate mask accentuating her striking eyes. When she entered the ballroom, heads turned — including Aiden’s.</p>

                <p>“Sheryl?” he said, his voice tinged with disbelief as she approached the group. His gaze lingered, and for a moment, she felt exposed, as though he could see straight through her.</p>

                <p>“You look… amazing,” he said, his green eyes shining with sincerity.</p>

                <p>Sheryl felt her cheeks flush beneath her mask. “Thanks,” she said softly. “Look at you, all suited up to woo every woman here.”</p>

                <p>Aiden grinned, running a hand through his hair. “Trying my best.”</p>

                <p>The ballroom buzzed with laughter and music, the atmosphere electric as masks and elegant attire shimmered under the lights. Sheryl stood near the edge of the dance floor, content to observe the swirl of colors and movement.</p>

                <p>Then, out of nowhere, Aiden appeared in front of her, his signature grin lighting up his face. “Edris,” he said with a mock bow, offering his hand. “Can I have this dance?”</p>

                <p>Sheryl blinked, her heart skipping at the unexpected gesture. “Oh, I… I don’t really—”</p>

                <p>“Come on,” he said, his voice warm and encouraging. “It’s just one song. What’s the worst that could happen?”</p>

                <p>Before she could overthink it, she found herself taking his hand, her gloved fingers fitting awkwardly into his. He led her onto the dance floor, where their friends were already laughing and spinning to the upbeat rhythm.</p>

                <p>At first, Sheryl felt self-conscious, her movements stiff, but Aiden’s playful energy was infectious. He spun her around with exaggerated flair, making her laugh despite herself. In those moments, everything else melted away — the crowd, the noise, even her own hesitations.</p>

                <p>But as the tempo shifted, the song fading into a soft, romantic melody, the mood changed. Couples naturally paired off, moving closer under the dimmed lights. Sheryl hesitated, glancing around for a way to slip back into the background.</p>

                <p>Aiden turned to her briefly, his green eyes searching hers. Someone else from the group tapped him on the shoulder with a shy smile, silently asking for a dance. Aiden politely took her hand and moved with the beat.</p>

                <p>Sheryl stepped back, retreating toward the edges of the room. She wrapped her arms around herself, watching from a distance as Aiden swayed gracefully with his partner. His charm was magnetic, and the girl laughed easily at whatever he said.</p>

                <p>“Hey, you okay?”</p>

                <p>The voice startled her. Sheryl turned to see Hannah beside her, her mask slightly askew.</p>

                <p>“Oh, yeah. Just taking a breather,” she said, forcing a smile.</p>

                <p>Hannah followed her gaze toward the dance floor and arched an eyebrow knowingly. “He’s got that effect, doesn’t he?” she teased lightly.</p>

                <p>Sheryl opened her mouth to protest but was saved by Hannah’s sudden change in tone. “Wait… where’s my clutch?”</p>

                <p>The panic in Hannah’s voice set them both into action, retracing her steps. When they couldn’t find it, Sheryl crouched to look under a table, her chest tightening as Hannah’s breathing grew uneven.</p>

                <p>“What’s going on?” Aiden’s familiar voice broke through the noise, calm and steady.</p>

                <p>Sheryl looked up to see him standing there, his expression concerned but composed. His presence was like a grounding force.</p>

                <p>Hannah quickly explained, her words tumbling out in a rush.</p>

                <p>“Hey, it’s okay,” Aiden said gently, placing a reassuring hand on Hannah’s shoulder. “We’ll sort this out. Stay calm, yeah?”</p>

                <p>Turning to Sheryl, he gave her a small nod. “You check this side of the room. I’ll look near the bar. Don’t worry, we’ll find it.”</p>

                <p>Within minutes, Aiden returned, holding the clutch in his hand. “Found this near the bar,” he said, handing it to Hannah with a reassuring smile.</p>

                <p>Hannah let out a breath of relief, clutching the bag to her chest. “Oh my God, thank you! I don’t know what I would’ve done without it.”</p>

                <p>“It’s no big deal. Just glad it turned up,” Aiden said with a modest grin.</p>

                <p>“Still, I owe you one,” Hannah said, smiling as she zipped up her bag. “Maybe I should buy you a drink sometime as a thank-you?”</p>

                <p>Aiden smirked. “Careful, Hannah. I might just take you up on that.”</p>

                <p>Sheryl watched as Hannah laughed, her cheeks slightly flushed. Aiden had that effect on people—effortlessly charming, making you feel like the center of his attention, even if only for a moment.</p>

                <p>“No, but seriously, thank you both,” Hannah added, cutting through Sheryl’s thoughts. “I should head out before I lose something else.”</p>

                <p>Sheryl offered to walk with her, but Aiden spoke up. “I’ll come along. Can’t let two lovely ladies wander off alone, can I?”</p>

                <p>Hannah rolled her eyes playfully. “Oh, how noble.”</p>

                <p>They walked together, the summer air warm and thick with the sounds of distant laughter and music from nearby pubs. After dropping Hannah off, Sheryl and Aiden continued in companionable silence toward her accommodation, the quiet night wrapping around them like a soft cloak.</p>

                <p>“So, Cornwall,” Aiden said, hands in his pockets. “Finally going to tick the Minack Theatre off my list.”</p>

                <p>Sheryl smiled. “You’ve wanted to go for a while, haven’t you?”</p>

                <p>“Forever,” he admitted. “Outdoor theatre, dramatic cliffs, the sea in the background—it’s like something out of a dream.”</p>

                <p>She chuckled. “Just don’t get too lost in the magic and start performing yourself.”</p>

                <p>Aiden gasped in mock offense. “I would never steal the spotlight.” Then, with a mischievous grin, he added, “Unless absolutely necessary.”</p>

                <p>Sheryl rolled her eyes, but she couldn’t help but laugh.</p>

                <p>“You do realize it could rain, right?”</p>

                <p>“Adds to the drama,” he said with a wink. “I say, bring it on.”</p>

                <p>And his gaze lifted toward the sky. The night stretched above them, deep and endless, dotted with shimmering stars.</p>

                <p>“The stars are insane tonight,” he murmured, tilting his head. “You can actually see the constellations.”</p>

                <p>Sheryl followed his gaze, momentarily caught in the quiet beauty of it all. Then her voice softened. “The moon looks beautiful tonight..”</p>

                <p>Her breath hitched slightly as she said it. She didn’t look at him. She didn’t have to. She didn’t even know if it was love till then. But it felt like the stars had aligned to bring this moment together.</p>

                <p>“You know what that means in Japanese?” she asked carefully.</p>

                <p>Aiden frowned. “Nope.”</p>

                <p>She hesitated for a second before explaining, her voice quieter. “When someone says, ‘The moon looks beautiful tonight’ in Japan, it’s another way of saying ‘I love you.’”</p>

                <p>Aiden blinked in surprise and carefully observed the moon again. Then a slow, teasing smile spread across his lips. “I’m totally going to say this to my girlfriend.”</p>

                <p>Sheryl looked at him and felt her stomach drop even as she forced out a laugh. She had walked straight into that one.</p>

                <p>She turned her gaze back up to the sky, focusing on the stars instead of the sudden weight in her chest.</p>

                <p>“Go for it,” she said lightly. “Just don’t get the meaning wrong.”</p>

                <p>Aiden nudged her playfully. “Noted.”</p>

                <p>And just like that, the moment passed, slipping through her fingers before she could grasp what it really meant.</p>
