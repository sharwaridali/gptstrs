                <h1 class="display-4">Chapter 10: Through the Twilight</h1>
                <p>The wedding day unfolded at a breathtaking beachside venue, where the ocean breeze carried a serene melody over the gathering of family and friends. The ceremony began early, with the sun casting a golden glow upon the scene.</p>

                <p>Theo stood at the altar, his expression a mix of nervous anticipation and boundless joy. His hands clasped together as he awaited his bride. Then, at last, she arrived.</p>

                <p>As Hannah made her way down the aisle, the guests rose to their feet, a collective murmur of admiration spreading through them. She was radiant, moving gracefully with a soft smile playing on her lips. Her dress, elegant and flowing, caught the sunlight just right, making her seem almost ethereal. As she passed by the guests, hearts swelled with warmth.</p>

                <p>Among them stood Aiden, positioned in the left rows, his gaze naturally following the bride’s procession. Across from him, in the right rows, Sheryl stood as one of the bridesmaids, clad in a pastel-blue gown that perfectly suited the soft, romantic ambiance of the wedding. As their eyes met, time seemed to slow just for a moment.</p>

                <p>Sheryl offered a warm smile—subtle, effortless. Aiden held her gaze just a little longer than he should have, long enough for the warmth to linger even as she looked away. There was something in that fleeting exchange, something unspoken.</p>

                <p>The ceremony continued, vows were exchanged, and cheers erupted as Theo and Hannah were pronounced husband and wife. Love and laughter filled the air as the newlyweds celebrated before swiftly departing for Poland that very evening, embarking on their honeymoon.</p>

                <p>John bid his farewell as business obligations called him elsewhere. With their departure, only three remained—Aiden, Sheryl, and Gareth, who was tucked away in his room, lost in his work shift.</p>

                <p>As dusk neared, Aiden found himself on the North Tenby beach - alone, the soft hum of the waves his only company. The waves lapped gently against the shoreline, their rhythm steady and soothing, as he sat on the soft sands. His arms were loosely wrapped around his knees, his face serene yet lost in thought. The sky was painted in fiery hues of orange and pink, the sun dipping lower with every passing moment, casting a warm glow across the water. It was his birthday, but for Aiden, the quiet solitude of the beach felt like the perfect place to reflect.</p>

                <p>Sheryl spotted him from a distance, his figure unmistakable against the glowing horizon. She had a small box tucked under her arm, its ribbon barely holding against the wind as she approached. Her footsteps slowed when she saw him like this—calm, untethered, the Aiden she adored the most. She hesitated for a moment, savoring the sight of him, before softly walking closer.</p>

                <p>“You’re hiding,” she said gently, her voice breaking the stillness.</p>

                <p>Aiden glanced up, the corner of his mouth curving into a faint smile. “Not hiding. Just… thinking.”</p>

                <p>Sheryl sank onto the sand beside him, keeping some space between the two. “Thinking about what? Don’t tell me you’re brooding on your birthday.”</p>

                <p>He chuckled, low and soft. “Not brooding. Just… enjoying the quiet. It’s nice here.”</p>

                <p>She tilted her head, looking out at the horizon. The sun was almost gone, the colors deepening to crimson and gold. The world seemed to hold its breath, waiting for the stars to take over. Sheryl wrapped her arms around her knees, mimicking his posture, and let the stillness linger for a while.</p>

                <p>Finally, she broke the silence, her voice warm with awe. “The sunset is beautiful, isn’t it?”</p>

                <p>Aiden turned his head slightly, his gaze lingering on her instead of the horizon. A soft breeze ruffled her hair, and the colors of the sunset reflected in her eyes. His lips twitched into the faintest of smiles, one so fleeting it almost went unnoticed.</p>

                <p>“The moon is looking beautiful,” he murmured, his voice quiet but resolute.</p>

                <p>Sheryl blinked, caught off guard, and turned to follow his gaze. But the moon had only just risen, faint against the dusky sky, its light pale and unassuming compared to the vibrant sunset. She looked back at him, confusion flickering across her face, but he didn’t elaborate.</p>

                <p>Aiden’s expression softened, his eyes distant yet full of something she couldn’t quite place. The silence stretched between them, the sound of the waves filling the space where words might have been.</p>

                <p>The sun disappeared entirely, leaving only the moon to light their world.</p>

                <p>Sheryl's thoughts flooded with the memory of when she first met him. The way she observed him from a distance. Their interaction over these moon and sunset phrases. Their bond. She immediately forced herself back to the moment, then held out the small box. "Happy Birthday, Aiden," she said.</p>

                <p>Aiden took it from her hands, mouthing a thank you, but didn’t open it right away. Instead, he turned it over in his palm, his eyes on the box but his thoughts elsewhere. Sheryl thought of leaving as she sensed Aiden wanted to be alone. But his words stopped her abruptly.</p>

                <p>"I heard you liked me?"</p>

                <p>The words came out calm, almost casual, but they carried something heavier beneath them. A question laced with curiosity, maybe even a touch of disbelief.</p>

                <p>Sheryl’s breath hitched. It felt as if she had been caught red-handed, exposed in a way she hadn’t quite prepared for. But she refused to run away this time, her voice steady despite the rapid beat of her heart.</p>

                <p>"I still do."</p>

                <p>The words left her lips softly, but the moment they did, she felt a weight she hadn’t realized she’d been carrying suddenly lift. The air between them felt lighter, freer, as if something unspoken had finally found its way into the open.</p>

                <p>Aiden’s expression didn’t change right away, but something in his eyes flickered, something deep and unreadable. He let a beat of silence pass before speaking again, his voice quieter this time.</p>

                <p>"After all this time?"</p>

                <p>Sheryl’s lips curved just slightly, and without a moment’s hesitation, she answered.</p>

                <p>"Always."</p>

                <p>Aiden’s grip on the box tightened just a little, as if anchoring himself to something real in that moment. The waves rolled in gently, the moon rising higher above them, its silver glow casting a soft light over their faces.</p>

                <p>"I don’t get it... I haven’t even figured out anything in life. And you barely talked to me for years, Sheryl. And then you say you like me. Why?"</p>

                <p>Sheryl took a deep breath, trying to gather her words. "Because now that you already knew, I couldn't hide it anymore. But don't worry, it's nothing. These are just feelings, they’ll pass..." She forced a small, strained smile. "Anyway, I'm moving to the US next week. I got accepted to MIT for my Ph.D."</p>

                <p>Aiden blinked, momentarily caught with surprise. Then, after a beat, his expression softened. "MIT?"</p>

                <p>She nodded.</p>

                <p>Aiden exhaled, running a hand through his hair. "That’s huge, Sheryl. Congratulations. Really." His voice was genuine, but there was something unspoken lingering beneath it. "Why didn’t you tell me?”</p>

                <p>She scoffed. "Oh, like you told me about your company switch and promotion?"</p>

                <p>Aiden clenched his jaw. "You were never around to tell."</p>

                <p>Sheryl’s expression hardened. "I was just a message away, Aiden. Everyone else knew—Gareth, John, Hannah… the world knew but me?" Her voice was firm, but there was something quieter beneath it, something almost resigned. Then, as if catching herself, she softened. "I know, Aiden. I was never that important in your life. We never got that close."</p>

                <p>Aiden hesitated. "Yeah…" then muttered, “Who pushed me away?"</p>

                <p>She stilled, his words catching her off guard for a split second. But she didn’t argue. Instead, she nodded, her voice steady. "I did… because I didn’t want to hurt myself. I could see it. I never had a chance. There are so many other girls around, and you... casually entertaining everyone. And maybe I’m just one of them for you."</p>

                <p>Aiden let out a sharp breath, shaking his head. "That’s not fair. You know that’s just how the guys are. It doesn’t mean anything. And no, you were not one of them."</p>

                <p>Her stomach twisted, but she nodded as if she had expected that response. "Yeah. I know. Maybe that was the problem."</p>

                <p>Aiden opened his mouth and then shut it again. His frustration simmered beneath the surface, but he didn’t have the words to argue against the truth in her statement. Instead, he shook his head. "So what, you just convinced yourself it was pointless and decided to run?"</p>

                <p>"I decided to protect myself, Aiden!" she said.</p>

                <p>Aiden exhaled, rubbing his temples. "You could’ve told me."</p>

                <p>She laughed, almost tired. "And what? You would’ve magically seen me differently? Have you ever thought of me romantically? I just convinced myself you are a really good friend of mine, Aiden."</p>

                <p>He didn’t respond immediately, and that silence told her everything she needed to know.</p>

                <p>She sighed and said with quiet resolve, "And I don’t wanna lose our friendship. I like you... I will always like you as a person, as my friend."</p>

                <p>Silence settled between them, thick but not bitter. Aiden was trying to process everything. She always said the right things, he thought. He had never thought of her romantically. Far from being in love with her. It wasn’t something that was going to change overnight. And they were parting ways yet again. And it still felt heavy for him this time.</p>

                <p>Sheryl looked up at the night sky, where the moon had fully risen, casting a soft glow over the ocean. She thought but didn’t say this time—The moon is really looking beautiful tonight.</p>

                <p>She stood up and started walking away. Then she turned, taking in every detail of Aiden Wynne as if memorizing him. Soon, she’d be gone, moving across the world, and she wasn’t sure when—or if—she’d see him again.</p>

                <p>Aiden remained where he was for hours, the small box still in his hands. He exhaled slowly before finally opening it.</p>

                <p>Inside was a Rolex—the very one he had once mentioned to her in passing, the one he had promised himself he’d buy when he started earning. He had nearly forgotten about it. But she hadn’t.</p>

                <p>Tucked beside the watch was a small note.</p>

                <p><em>Your time is yours to choose. Happy birthday, Aiden! 🎂</em></p>

                <p>His fingers traced the edge of the paper, his gaze lingering on the words longer than he expected. A strange tightness settled in his chest. He had never given much thought to how much she had paid attention—to the little things, the fleeting words, the moments he had dismissed as nothing.</p>

                <p>And now, standing there alone with the weight of her words and the realization of everything left unsaid, Aiden finally understood.</p>

                <p>But it was too late.</p>

                <p>The waves crashed softly against the shore. The moon shone bright above him. And for the first time that night, he didn’t know how to feel.</p>
